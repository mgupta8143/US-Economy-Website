    <p class="lead text-light">The U.S Dollar Index (USDX) is a measure of the value of the USD in comparison to six other major currencies (EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, SEK, CHF). It is commonly accepted as a major means by measuring the U.S Dollar, although it has been criticized for weighing the Euro heavily. The index rises when the U.S dollar rises in value.</p>
